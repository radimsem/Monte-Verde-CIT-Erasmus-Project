# Monte Verde CIT Erasmus 2023 Project

## Students:
- Lukáš Hampl
- Jonáš Javůrek
- Zdeněk Michalec
- Radim Semerák

## Activities:
1. Create a plan for a booking system. At this moment, the webpage is forwarding users to booking. We can create a strategy for the hotel to receive direct booking without the help of Booking.

2. Update pictures. The accommodation doesn’t have a picture of the rooms and the main areas.

3. Make an itinerary of what to do and see in Madeira. Prepare an itinerary with things that people can see and can do in
Madeira island.

4. Create a new Menu. The menu bar has to be updated and improved. At this moment, the menu bar is not good for people who are visiting the website.

5. Include a link with main activities to do in Madeira. It could be partners and suggestions for example.
